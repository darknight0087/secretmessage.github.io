                        <strong>Dear Person.</strong>
                        <p>
                            Now you know everything about how much I feel, how much I don't... I can't tell you why I love you.
                            1. Your voice is very lovely 
                            2. I spoke the way you did and no one else did in my entire life. 
                            3. Thank you so much for showing so much trust in me for the first time. 
                            4. And there is a very point which I cannot explain because that feeling will tell you everything, then what will be left for later.\n
                            5. And feelings are not temporary and feelings end.... and no matter how much I have to wait, I am in no hurry......
                            And in the end I have to say that I remain happy... because I like your smile so much...
                            And thank you so much for reading this message completely...'''
